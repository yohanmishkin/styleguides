# Ember

## Patterns

### Ember Data models

1. Relationships should appear before attributes in file

Commonly, relationships are more complex than attributes. Because of their heightened complexity they should be more prominently displayed.

## Antipatterns

1. Unnecessarily nested routes

Only use nested routes when a need for shared ui arises (example: list/detail ui)
